- figure out less chaotic way of handling keyboard shortcuts -- if anything has focus, shouldn't do single keystroke things?
- offer to create tags based on filters
- add 'clear all filters'
- update tags being checked based on what people type in filter box
- persist tags!
- figure out what to do about markdown -- maybe do just bold, italic, and autolinkify/phoneify
- clear selection on filter, so we don't operate on hidden notes.
