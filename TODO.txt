BUGS


CLEANUP

  - figure out less chaotic way of handling keyboard shortcuts -- if anything has focus, shouldn't do single keystroke things?

FEATURES
  - figure out inbox + today + next implications (offer more categories?)
    - keyboard nav vs. keyboard changes of status
    - drag & drop?

  - figure out offline writes & sync strategy
    - talk to mconnor or thunder about sync server and how generic it is
    
  - add email fetching or email receiving so that emails can become todos trivially
    - gmail oauth + look for starred messages in inbox
    - forward to gmail+tasks w/ filter to auto-star those messages

  - add traditional username/pw auth for those folks
  - filters
    - offer to create tags based on filters
    - add 'clear all filters'
    - update tags being checked based on what people type in filter box
    - persist tags!
    - clear selection on filter, so we don't operate on hidden notes.
  - make lasso selection work

DECISIONS
  - figure out what to do about markdown -- maybe do just bold, italic, and autolinkify/phoneify
  - make social?
    - on auth, redirect to /<username>
    - on view of someone else's view, offer a "add task" button.
    - show "incoming tasks" in main view
    - virality is: if person doesn't have account, send an email saying that i'm asking you to do this, let me know when it's done.
