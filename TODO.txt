- figure out less chaotic way of handling keyboard shortcuts -- if anything has focus, shouldn't do single keystroke things?
- offer to create tags based on filters
- add 'clear all filters'
- update tags being checked based on what people type in filter box
- persist tags!
- figure out what to do about markdown -- maybe do just bold, italic, and autolinkify/phoneify
- clear selection on filter, so we don't operate on hidden notes.
- convert filtering to use classes so that masonry can do its magic (http://desandro.com/demo/masonry/docs/filtering.html)
- figure out inbox + today + next
- make top part minimal:

  [ username ]  [ new ] [ mark done ] [ delete marked ]
  
- make lasso selection work
