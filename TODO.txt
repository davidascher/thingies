BUGS

  - on update, ensure reflow and tag updating

CLEANUP

  - figure out less chaotic way of handling keyboard shortcuts -- if anything has focus, shouldn't do single keystroke things?
  - make top part minimal:
    [ username ]  [ new ] [ mark done ] [ delete marked ]

FEATURES
  - make mark done actually do that. (and be 'mark undone' if all are marked)
  - make clean up do that
  - figure out inbox + today + next
  - offer to create tags based on filters
  - add 'clear all filters'
  - update tags being checked based on what people type in filter box
  - persist tags!
  - clear selection on filter, so we don't operate on hidden notes.
  - make lasso selection work

DECISIONS
  - figure out what to do about markdown -- maybe do just bold, italic, and autolinkify/phoneify
